In this world-water-levels-visualisation project, I solve the gap between abstract warming targets & concrete coastal risk. 
I have built an interactive CesiumJS 3D globe where users set relative temp. increase & run a 5000-iteration Monte Carlo simulation across five sea-level contributors.

Flooded land is rendered using a custom shader with per-fragment EGM96 geoid correction, plus scenario comparison & city fly-to views.
The goal is to turn climate risk into visual, decision-ready insight for planners.
