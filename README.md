# 🌊 World Water Levels Visualization

A 3D globe visualization of sea level rise using Monte Carlo simulation, built with CesiumJS.

## Features

- **3D Globe** — Interactive Earth with satellite imagery and high-resolution terrain
- **Monte Carlo Simulation** — 5,000-iteration simulation modeling 5 contributors to sea level rise (thermal expansion, glaciers, Greenland, Antarctica, land water storage)
- **Temperature Controls** — Preset buttons for +1°C, +2°C, +3°C, +5°C, +8°C, +10°C, plus fine-grained ±0.05°C increment buttons (range: 0–10°C)
- **Flood Visualization** — Custom Globe.material GLSL shader that colors terrain fragments below the projected flood height, with per-fragment EGM96 geoid correction for regional accuracy
- **Location Fly-to** — Quick navigation to vulnerable regions: Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Netherlands, NYC, Mumbai, Shanghai
- **Comparison Mode** — Compare current simulation with previous snapshot; the shader highlights the delta in orange
- **Statistics** — Median, mean, 5th/95th percentile SLR, contributor breakdown, and population-at-risk estimates
- **Onboarding Walkthrough** — 4-slide introductory overlay explaining sea level rise, Monte Carlo simulation, and how to use the tool

## Setup

### 1. Get a Cesium Ion Access Token (free)

1. Sign up at [https://ion.cesium.com/signup/](https://ion.cesium.com/signup/)
2. After signing in, go to **Access Tokens**
3. Copy your default access token

### 2. Set Environment Variable

The token is read from the `CESIUM_ION_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable at build/dev time:

```bash
export CESIUM_ION_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-token-here"
```

To make it permanent, add the line above to your `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc`).

### 3. Install and Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

If the environment variable is not set, the app will prompt for the token on load.

## How It Works

### Monte Carlo Model

The simulation models sea level rise from 5 physical contributors, each with uncertainty distributions based on IPCC AR5/AR6 data:

- **Thermal Expansion** — 0.12 m/°C ± 0.04, linear scaling
- **Mountain Glaciers** — 0.10 m/°C ± 0.03, slightly sub-linear (glaciers deplete)
- **Greenland Ice Sheet** — 0.06 m/°C ± 0.04, super-linear (exponent 1.4)
- **Antarctic Ice Sheet** — 0.05 m/°C ± 0.08, highly non-linear (exponent 1.8, MICI risk)
- **Land Water Storage** — 0.01 m/°C ± 0.01, linear

Antarctic contribution has the highest uncertainty due to Marine Ice Cliff Instability (MICI) risk.

#### Monte Carlo Implementation Details (Exact)

- **Iterations per simulation run:** `5000`
- **Primary input variable:** Relative temperature increase in °C (`tempIncrease`, from UI controls in the `0.00` to `10.00` range)
- **Contributors sampled each iteration (5 total):**
  - Thermal Expansion
  - Mountain Glaciers
  - Greenland Ice Sheet
  - Antarctic Ice Sheet
  - Land Water Storage
- **Per-contributor sampling formula per iteration:**
  - `scaledTemp = tempIncrease ^ nonLinearExponent`
  - `mean = meanPerDeg * scaledTemp`
  - `std = stdPerDeg * sqrt(tempIncrease)`
  - sampled value uses a Gaussian draw via Box-Muller transform
  - sampled value is clamped to non-negative (`max(0, sampledValue)`)
- **Total SLR per iteration:** Sum of all 5 sampled contributor values (meters)
- **Output statistics computed from sorted iteration totals:**
  - `mean`, `median (p50)`, `p5`, `p95`, `min`, `max`
- **Seeded reproducibility:**
  - PRNG: deterministic `Mulberry32` when a seed is provided
  - Seed used by UI: `seed = 1337 + round(tempIncrease * 1000)`
  - This makes each temperature scenario deterministic/repeatable across runs
- **Optimization/shortcuts used to reduce runs:** None
  - No early stopping
  - No adaptive sampling
  - No variance-reduction methods (e.g., Latin Hypercube, antithetic variates)
  - Full fixed-size Monte Carlo (`5000` samples) every run
- **Performance note:** Histogram and statistics reuse the same sampled run; switching flood display mode (Median vs P95) does not rerun Monte Carlo.

### Flood Visualization

A custom GLSL shader is applied to the Cesium globe via `Globe.material`. The shader checks each terrain fragment's ellipsoidal height against the flood level and tints it amber if below. This avoids the depth-testing issues of translucent entity overlays.

The flood level is computed as:

```
ellipsoidal flood height = geoid undulation + sea level rise
```

Flooding uses an EGM96 geoid texture sampled per-fragment (the offset between the WGS84 ellipsoid and mean sea level), so correction is global and continuous rather than tied to a single location offset.

**Note:** This is a simplified model. Real sea level rise is not uniform globally and depends on ocean dynamics, gravitational effects of ice sheets, and local land subsidence.
